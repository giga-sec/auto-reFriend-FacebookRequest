# Description
- The idea came from tediously re-sending friend requests to potential prospects. Instead of manually re-friending, I crafted a logical code that automatically re-sent friend request to prospects. 
- The logical motivation comes from successful entrepreneurs often is flooded with lots of friend requests. Therefore, my profile might already be buried down the list. Re-friending them will allow me to show up at the top of their friend requests list.
